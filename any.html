</p>

<p>
    Mocam is here to help you realise riches.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><i>
        We are on a mission to build the most visited website in Nigeria.
    </i></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Driving our vision is your sweet {defaults.siteName} Nigeria Product Search Engine.
</p>
<p>
    We have come up with Mocam to make our mission successful while earning good money for you.
    Mocam is a referral programme like no other.
</p>
<p>
    We intend for members of Mocam to aggressively advertise {defaults.siteName} while making money for themselves.
    To become a member of Mocam, you register with
    <strong><i> &#8358;{defaults.amountPaidForReferer.toLocaleString()}</i></strong>.
</p>
<p>
    This amount is credited to the account of your referrer, just like you would be credited if you refer someone to this programme,
    in other words
    <strong><i> We don't make any profit, with this programme, it's only a means to advertise our Search Engine.
    </i></strong>
<p>
    You get two links; a Mocam Referral Link also known as <strong><i>Moref</i></strong> and a Mocam Invitation link which we call <strong><i>Molin</i></strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Anytime someone joins Mocam using your Moref, you earn <strong><i>&#8358;{defaults.amountPaidForReferer.toLocaleString()}</i></strong>, If you get a thousand people joining Mocam using your Moref, do the maths!
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Your Molin is also a potential money spinner!
</p>

<p>
    The Molin is a link that drives visitors to watch our presentation video.

</p>
<p>
    Every time someone clicks on your Molin, they are directed to our site to watch this video.
</p>
<p>
    We have deployed advanced programming to identify unique visitors to our videos.
</p>
<p>
    So whenever a unique visitor uses your Molin to watch our video, you are paid <strong><i>&#8358;{defaults.amountPaidForUniqueVisitor}</i></strong>,
    If your link gets a thousand clicks a day, you earn a sweet &#8358;{(defaults.amountPaidForUniqueVisitor * 1000).toLocaleString()}.
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE ALSO :</strong></p>
<p>
    Your account will be credited with <strong><i>&#8358;{defaults.amountPaidForReferer.toLocaleString()}</i></strong> each time your username is used to re-activate an in-active account, this way,
    you are sure of payments even when you've referred everyone you know.
</p>

<p>This also prevents the programme from becoming a Ponzi Scheme</p>

<p>
    The advantage of keeping your Moref is that very successful Morefs would get special packages like all paid vacations abroad from {defaults.siteName} Studio occasionally.
</p>
<p>
    Other incentives like new cars, houses and other gifts would be offered to members with very successful Morefs from time to time!
    If you are still wondering how to start earning these fast bucks, itâ€™s as easy as having social media accounts. Paste your Moref and/or your Molin as your signature on social media sites.
</p>

<p>
    Place your link as signature on all your comments on social media sites and of course, invite your family and friends to sign up on Mocam using your Moref!
</p>
<p>
